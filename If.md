If, like in all programming language, is here to execute code if the condition is true.

(Guide)

`==` is =\
`!=` is â‰ \
`>` is >\
`<` is <\
`>=` is > or =\
`<=` is < or =\
`&&` is And\
`||` is Or

**Examples and how to use:**

var int Number\
input(n"Choose a number between 1 and 5.", Number)

if Number == 3\
print("Correct!")\
else\
print("Incorrect!")\
end

Another example:

var str OS\
input(s"Which Operating System is better?", OS)

if OS != "Linux"\
print("No, it's Linux.")\
else\
print("Yes, it is Linux!")

**I think you understant how it works now!**
