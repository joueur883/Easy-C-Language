**The input() is used to ask something to the user, and store the answer in a variable.**

**How to use it?**

Example :

var int Number
input(n"Choose a number between 1 and 2. ", Number)

**What does this code?**\
This code creates a new blank variable names **Number** of type **int (a number)**
Then it **creates a new input of type number (the "n" before "Choose a number(...)"), **writes the question before the input**, and then **store the answer in the Number variable.**
