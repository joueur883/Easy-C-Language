**Lesson #1 : Print Hello World!**

Normally, in the **C Programming Language**, to print "Hello World" in the console, you need to write this :

#include <stdio.h>

*int main() {
  printf("Hello World!}
}*

but in the **Easy C Programming Language**, you only have to write


*print("Hello World")*


Similar to Python, right? And next, the Easy C Programming Language converter will convert it to the C code.

⚠️**WARNING!**

The **Easy C Programming Language Converter** online on PenguinMod **only converts the Easy C code to the C correct code**, but **don't compile it**. **You will need to use gcc to compile it manually before you can run it, or use a C code runner online.**
