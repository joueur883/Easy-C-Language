**Lesson #1 : Print Hello World!**

Normally, in the **C Programming Language**, to print "Hello World" in the console, you need to write this :

#include <stdio.h>

*int main() {
  printf("Hello World!}
}*

but in the **Easy C Programming Language**, you only have to write


*print("Hello World")*


Similar to Python, right? And next, the Easy C Programming Language converter will convert it to the C code.
