# What is the Easy C Programming Language?

**Easy C Programming Language** is a simplified way to write C programs using easy-to-remember syntax and beginner-friendly keywords.  
It‚Äôs perfect for learning how to code without getting overwhelmed by the classic C complexity!

‚ú® Whether you're a beginner or just want to write faster, Easy C makes coding in C more fun and accessible.

‚ö†Ô∏è**WARNING! Before starting!**

**Easy C is an experimental programming language for now.**\
The **Easy C Programming Language Converter** (see releases) **only converts the Easy C code to the C correct code**, but **don't compile it**. **You will need to use gcc to compile it manually before you can run it, or use a C code runner online.**


üìò Start with the `01- Print Hello World.md` file to dive into your first Easy C lines and understand how it all works!
